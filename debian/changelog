dnscrypt-proxy (2.0.43~ppa2) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Built-in support for DNS64 translation has been implemented. (Contributed by Sergey Smirnov, thanks!)
  * Connections to DoH servers can be authenticated using TLS client certificates (Contributed by Kevin O'Sullivan, thanks!)
  * Multiple stamps are now allowed for a single server in resolvers and relays lists.
  * Android: the time zone for log files is now set to the system time zone.
  * Quite a lot of updates and additions have been made to the example domain block lists. Thanks to `IceCodeNew`!
  * Cached configuration files can now be temporarily used if they are out of date, but bootstraping is impossible. Contributed by `lifenjoiner`, thanks!
  * Precompiled macOS binaries are now notarized.
  * `generate-domains-blacklists` now tries to deduplicate entries clobbered by wildcard rules. Thanks to `Huhni`!
  * `generate-domains-blacklists` can now directly write lists to a file with the `-o` command-line option.
  * cache files are now downloaded as the user the daemon will be running as. This fixes permission issues at startup time.
  * Forwarded queries are now subject to global timeouts, and can be forced to use TCP.
  * The `ct` parameter has been removed from DoH queries, as Google doesn't require it any more.
  * Service installation is now supported on FreeBSD.
  * When stored into a file, service logs now only contain data from the most recent launch. This can be changed with the new `log_file_latest` option.

dnscrypt-proxy (2.0.42~ppa2) bionic; urgency=medium

  * The current versions of the dnsdist load balancer (presumably used by quad9, cleanbrowsing, qualityology, freetsa.org, ffmuc.net, opennic-bongobow, sth-dnscrypt-se, ams-dnscrypt-nl and more) is preventing queries over 1500 bytes from being received over UDP.
  * Temporary workarounds have been introduced to improve reliability with these resolvers for regular DNSCrypt. Unfortunately, anonymized DNS cannot be reliable until the issue is fixed server-side.
  * dnsdist authors are aware of it and are working on a fix.
  * New option in the [anonymized_dns] section: skip_incompatible, to ignore resolvers incompatible with Anonymized DNS instead of using them without a relay.
  * The server latency benchmark is faster while being able to perform more retries if necessary.
  * Continuous integration has been moved to GitHub Actions.

dnscrypt-proxy (2.0.41~ppa18) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Precompiled ARM binaries are compatible with armv5 CPUs. The default arm builds were not compatible with older CPUs when compiled with Go 1.14. mips64 binaries are explicitly compiled with softfloat to improve compatibility.
  * Quad9 seems to be only blocking fragmented queries over UDP for some networks. They have been removed from the default list of broken resolvers; runtime detection of support for fragments should now do the job.
  * Runtime detection of support for fragments was actually enabled.
  * Servers blocking fragmented queries are now automatically detected.
  * The server name is now only present in query logs when an actual upstream servers was required to resolve a query.
  * TLS client authentication has been added for DoH.
  * The Firefox plugin is now skipped for connections coming from the local DoH server.
  * DoH RTT computation is now more accurate, especially when CDNs are in the middle.
  * The forwarding plugin is now more reliable, and handles retries over TCP.

dnscrypt-proxy (2.0.39~ppa1~bionic) bionic; urgency=medium

  * The Firefox Local DoH service didn't properly work in version 2.0.38; this has been fixed. Thanks to Simon Brand for the report!
  * Entries from lists (forwarding, blacklists, whitelists) now support inline comments.
  * Reliability improvement: queries over UDP are retried after a timeout instead of solely relying on the client.
  * Reliability improvement: during temporary network outages, cached records are now served even if they are stale.
  * Bug fix: SOCKS proxies and DNS relays can be combined.
  * New feature: multiple fallback resolvers are now supported (see the new fallback_resolvers option. Note that fallback_resolver is still supported for backward compatibility).
  * Windows: the service can be installed with a configuration file stored separately from the application.
  * Security (affecting DoH): precompiled binaries of dnscrypt-proxy 2.0.37 are built using Go 1.13.7 that fixes a TLS certificate parsing issue present in previous versions of the compiler.
  * New option: block_undelegated. When enabled, dnscrypt-proxy will directly respond to queries for locally-served zones (https://sk.tl/2QqB971U) and nonexistent zones that should have been kept local, but are frequently leaked. This reduces latency and improves privacy.
  * Conformance: the DO bit is now set in synthetic responses if it was set in a question, and the AD bit is cleared.
  * The miegkg/dns module was updated to version 1.1.26, that fixes a security issue affecting non-encrypted/non-authenticated DNS traffic. In dnscrypt-proxy, this only affects the forwarding feature.
  * New option: block_unqualified to block A/AAAA queries with unqualified host names. These will very rarely get an answer from upstream resolvers, but can leak private information to these, as well as to root servers.
  * When a CNAME pointer is blocked, the original query name is now logged along with the pointer. This makes it easier to know what the original query name, so it can be whitelisted, or what the pointer was, so it can be removed from the blacklist.
  * Blacklisted names are now also blocked if they appear in CNAME pointers.
  * dnscrypt-proxy can now act as a local DoH server. Firefox can be configured to use it, so that ESNI can be enabled without bypassing your DNS proxy.

dnscrypt-proxy (2.0.33~ppa1~bionic) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Fixes an issue that caused some valid queries to return PARSE_ERROR.
  * On certificate errors, the server name is now logged instead of the provider name, which is generally more useful.
  * IP addresses for DoH servers that require DNS lookups are now cached for at least 12 hours.
  * ignore_system_dns is now set to true by default.
  * A workaround for a bug in Cisco servers has been implemented.
  * A corrupted or incomplete resolvers list is now ignored, keeping the last good known cached list until the next update. In addition, logging was improved and unit tests were also added. Awesome contribution from William Elwood, thanks!
  * On Windows, the network probe immediately returned instead of blocking if netprobe_timeout was set to -1. This has been fixed.
  * Expired cached IP addresses now have a grace period, to avoid breaking the service if they temporarily can't be refreshed.
  * On Windows, the service now returns immediately, solving a long-standing issue when initialization took more than 30 seconds ("The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion"). Fantastic work by Alison Winters, thanks!
  * The SERVER_ERROR error code has been split into two new error codes: NETWORK_ERROR (self-explanatory) and SERVFAIL (a response was returned, but it includes a SERVFAIL error code).
  * Responses are now always compressed.

dnscrypt-proxy (2.0.30~ppa1~bionic) bionic; urgency=medium

  * 2.0.29:
    * Support for Anonymized DNS has been added!
    * Wait before stopping, fixing an issue with Unbound (thanks to Vladimir Bauer)
    * DNS stamps are now included in the -list-all -json ouptut
    * The netprobe_timeout setting from the configuration file or command-line was ignored. This has been fixed.
    * The TTL or cloaked entries can now be adjusted (thanks to Markus Linnala)
    * Cached IP address from DoH servers now expire (thanks to Markus Linnala)
    * DNSCrypt certificates can be fetched over Tor and SOCKS proxies
    * Retries over TCP are faster
    * Improved logging (thanks to Alison Winters)
    * Ignore non-TXT records in certificate responses (thanks to Vladimir Bauer)
    * A lot of internal cleanups, thanks to Markus Linnala

  * 2.0.29 beta 3:
    * Improved logging
    * Added a workaround for DNS servers using a non-standard provider name.

  * 2.0.29 beta 2:
    * Support for Anonymized DNSCrypt has been added.
    * Latency with large responses has actually been reduced.
    * DNSCrypt certificates can now be retrieved over Tor, proxies, and DNS relays.
    * Improved server error reporting (thanks to Alison Winters)
    * Quite a lot of internal improvements and bug fixes have been made, thanks to Markus Linnala.

  * 2.0.29 beta 1:
    * Preliminary support for anonymized DNS is here!

  * 2.0.28:
    * Invalid server entries are now skipped instead of preventing a source from being used. Thanks to Alison Winters for the contribution!
    * Truncated responses are immediately retried over TCP instead of waiting for the client to retry. This reduces the latency for large responses.
    * Responses sent to the local network are assumed to support at least 1252 bytes packets, and use optional information from EDNS up to 4096 bytes. This also reduces latency.
    * Logging improvements: servers are not logged for cached, synthetic and cloaked responses. And the forwarder is logged instead of the regular server for forwarded responses.

  * 2.0.27:
    * The X25519 implementation was changed from using the Go standard implementation to using Cloudflare's CIRCL library. Unfortunately, CIRCL appears to be broken on big-endian systems. That change has been reverted.
    * All the dependencies have been updated.

  * 2.0.26:
    * A new plugin was added to prevent Firefox from bypassing the system DNS settings.
    * New configuration parameter to set how to respond to blocked queries: blocked_query_response. Responses can now be empty record sets, REFUSED response codes, or predefined IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses.
    * The refused_code_in_responses and blocked_query_response options have been folded into a new blocked_query_response option.
    * The fallback resolver is now accessed using TCP if force_tcp has been set to true.
    * CPU usage when enabling DNSCrypt ephemeral keys has been reduced.
    * New command-line option: -show-certs to print DoH certificate hashes.
    * Solaris packages are now provided.
    * DoH servers on a non-standard port, with stamps that don't include IP addresses, and without working system resolvers can now be properly bootstrapped.
    * A new option, query_meta, is now available to add optional records to client queries.

dnscrypt-proxy (2.0.25~ppa1~bionic) bionic; urgency=medium

  * The query log now includes the time it took to complete the transaction, the name of the resolver that sent the response and if the response was served from the cache. Thanks to Ferdinand Holzer for his help!
  * The list of resolvers, sorted by latency, is now printed after all the resolvers have been probed.
  * The "fastest" load-balancing strategy has been renamed to "first".
  * On Windows, a nul byte is sent to the netprobe address. This is required to check for connectivity on this platform. Thanks to Mathias Berchtold.
  * The Malwaredomainlist URL was updated to directly parse the host list. Thanks to Encrypted.Town.
  * The Python script to generate lists of blacklisted domains is now compatible both with Python 2 and Python 3. Thanks to Simon R.

  * A crash with loaded-balanced sets of cloaked names was fixed. Thanks to @InkblotAdmirer for the report.
  * Resolvers are now tried in random order to avoid favoring the first ones at startup.
  * The example IP address for network probes didn't work on Windows - This is a regression introduced in version 2.0.24.
  * The example configuration file has been updated and the fallback resolver IP is now used when no netprobe address has been configured.

  * BOMs are now ignored in configuration files.
  * In addition to SOCKS, HTTP and HTTPS proxies are now supported for DoH servers.
  * The value for `netprobe_timeout` was read from the command-line, but not from the configuration file any more. This is a regression introduced in the previous version, that has been fixed.
  * The default value for netprobe timeouts has been raised to 60 seconds.

dnscrypt-proxy (2.0.9~ppa1~bionic) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Whitelists have been implemented: one a name matches a pattern in the whitelist, rules from the name-based and IP-based blacklists will be bypassed. Whitelists support the same patterns as blacklists, as well as time-based rules, so that some website can be normally blocked, but accessible on specific days or times of the day.
  * Lists are now faster to load, and large lists require significantly less memory than before.
  * New options have been added to disable TLS session tickets as well as use a specific cipher suite. See the example configuration file for a recommended configuration to speed up DoH servers on ARM such as Android devices and Raspberry Pi.
  * The -service install command now remembers what the current directory was when the service was installed, in order to later load configuration files with relative paths.
  * DoH: The "Cache-Control: max-age" header is now ignored.
  * Patterns can now be prefixed with = to do exact matching: =example.com matches example.com but will not match www.example.com.
  * Patterns are now fully supported by the cloaking module.
  * A new option was added to use a specific cipher suite instead of the server's provided one. Using RSA+ChaChaPoly over ECDSA+AES-GCM has shown to decrease CPU usage and latency when connecting to Cloudflare, especially on Mips and ARM systems.
  * The ephemeral keys mode of dnscrypt-proxy v1.x was reimplemented: this creates a new unique key for every single query.
